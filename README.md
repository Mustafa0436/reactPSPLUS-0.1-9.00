# reactPSPLUS

A simple code that will reset PS4 internal clock back to 2013 thus in turn activating PS+ Games that has been previously or are currently on the console

## Build
This build is ported to 9.00 from 5.05 and will only work on 9.00. 
Shoutout to my man RFOODXMODZ for finding 9.00 offsets

## Download
[reactPSPLUS-0.1-9.00.bin](https://github.com/Mustafa0436/reactPSPLUS-0.1/releases/download/0.1/reactPSPLUS-0.1-9.00.bin)

## Requirement

* PS4 must (at the moment) be on firmware 9.00
* Payload Sender 

## Notes
the payload would set the internal clock to 2013 and your PS+ games would start working,
you wouldn't even need to have HEN enabled to use these games since they're legit games and would work normally like any digital game,
if you're not connected to the internet, you will not need to run this exploit again.
it might be worthwhile dumping your games to make sure you never lose access to them.
